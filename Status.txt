TODO:
- support passing nested object references as context instead of just root level object properties
- support passing same context object also as context to child objects
- data diff should be done inorder to rerender components - preferably automatically

- replace temp-store with redux
- replace dependency on JSON with immutable.js

- components must be preferred to accept markup rather than dataContext objects
